    <h1>Naana Sarkodie</h1>
    <p>
      Naana Akosua Tabuah Sarkodie is a third year student of Ashesi studying Management information Systems. 
      Management Information Systems is a combination of computer science and business administration, 
      it is a very interesting course.
      Naana will graduate hopefully in 2022.

      Naana loves to read, draw and write poems. When she is not doing any of this she finds herself
      giving advice to her friends and other people who want it. She also loves to watch movies and hang
      out with family and friends. AN interesting fact about Naana is that, horror movies make her laugh.
